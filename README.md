# Psychic-Game

The game is played by selecting any letter (ex. a, j, t, etc) key. The player has 9 chances to guess the letter. If the player guesses correctly, 1 point will be added to the Wins and the game resets. If the player does not succesfully guess the correct letter after 9 attemps, one point will be added to Losses and the game resets.
